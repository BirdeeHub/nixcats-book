# Alternative Projects to NixCats

Here are some noteworthy projects that provide alternative approaches to Neovim configuration and Nix integration. While each has its strengths, NixCats aims to address specific gaps in functionality and design. Explore these projects to find the one that best suits your needs:

#### [**kickstart.nvim**](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
  A minimalist, ready-to-use Neovim configuration starter for beginners.
- **How it Differs:**  
  - Does **NOT** use Nix for plugin management.
  - Focuses on simplicity and traditional Lua-based configurations.

---

#### [**kickstart-nix.nvim**](https://github.com/mrcjkb/kickstart-nix.nvim)
  A Nix-based configuration built on `wrapNeovimUnstable` with no additional abstractions.
- **How it Differs**:  
  - Maintains a standard Neovim structure while leveraging Nix for reproducibility.
  - Emphasizes raw control with minimal abstraction.

---

#### [**NixVim**](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim)
  A module-based Neovim configuration system, somewhat akin to Home Manager.
- **How it Differs**:  
  - Provides a large library of pre-configured plugin modules.
  - Falls back to `programs.neovim` for unsupported plugins.

---

#### [**Luca's super simple Neovim flake**](https://github.com/Quoteme/neovim-flake)
  A highly minimal example of integrating Nix with Neovim.
- **How it Differs**:  
  - Focuses on simplicity, providing a beginner-friendly introduction to Nix and Neovim integration.
  - Serves as a great springboard for learning the basics.

---

#### [**nixPatch-nvim**](https://github.com/NicoElbers/nixPatch-nvim)
  A specialized tool for managing `lazy.nvim` configurations using Nix and Zig.
- **How it Differs**:  
  - Parses and replaces plugin URLs at build time.
  - Focused exclusively on `lazy.nvim` with unique build-time functionality.
