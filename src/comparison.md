# Alternative Projects to NixCats

Here are some noteworthy projects that provide alternative approaches to Neovim configuration and Nix integration. While each has its strengths, NixCats aims to address specific gaps in functionality and design. Explore these projects to find the one that best suits your needs:

#### [**kickstart.nvim**](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
  A minimalist, ready-to-use Neovim configuration starter for beginners.
- **How it Differs:**  
  - Does **NOT** use Nix for plugin management.
  - Focuses on simplicity and traditional Lua-based configurations.

- **When to Use:** If you're new to Neovim, this is an excellent first step. Transition to NixCats later if you wish to integrate Nix for reproducibility and advanced configuration.

---

#### [**kickstart-nix.nvim**](https://github.com/mrcjkb/kickstart-nix.nvim)
  A Nix-based configuration built on `wrapNeovimUnstable` with no additional abstractions.
- **How it Differs**:  
  - Maintains a standard Neovim structure while leveraging Nix for reproducibility.
  - Emphasizes raw control with minimal abstraction.

- **When to Use**: If NixCats feels too abstract or complex, this project is a good choice for hands-on, ground-up configuration.

---

#### [**NixVim**](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim)
  A module-based Neovim configuration system, somewhat akin to Home Manager.
- **How it Differs**:  
  - Provides a large library of pre-configured plugin modules.
  - Falls back to `programs.neovim` for unsupported plugins.

- **When to Use**: For users who want declarative plugin management without extensive customization.

#### [**Luca's super simple Neovim flake**](https://github.com/Quoteme/neovim-flake)
  A highly minimal example of integrating Nix with Neovim.
- **How it Differs**:  
  - Focuses on simplicity, providing a beginner-friendly introduction to Nix and Neovim integration.
  - Serves as a great springboard for learning the basics.

- **When to Use**: If you're new to Nix and functional programming, this project is a fantastic starting point. It inspired the foundation of **NixCats**.

---

#### [**nixPatch-nvim**](https://github.com/NicoElbers/nixPatch-nvim)
  A specialized tool for managing `lazy.nvim` configurations using Nix and Zig.
- **How it Differs**:  
  - Parses and replaces plugin URLs at build time.
  - Focused exclusively on `lazy.nvim` with unique build-time functionality.

- **When to Use**: If you’re specifically looking to manage `lazy.nvim` setups with Nix, this project offers a focused solution.

### **Choosing the Right Project**
- **Start Simple**: Try **kickstart.nvim** or **Luca's super simple** to ease into Neovim or Nix configurations.

- **Expand with Nix**: Move to **kickstart-nix.nvim** or **NixVim** for more control and a broader ecosystem.

- **Embrace NixCats**: For a modular, customizable, and scalable configuration that balances abstraction with flexibility, choose NixCats. It’s a project designed to grow with your expertise. Comparison
