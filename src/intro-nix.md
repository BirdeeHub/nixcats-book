# Nix
`Nix` is a functional programming language and `Nix-Cli(aka nix)` is a declarative package manager designed to create reproducible and declarative software environments. It works by treating configurations as code, ensuring that every aspect of your environment is consistent, version-controlled, and isolated. One of Nixâ€™s standout features is its ability to manage software dependencies seamlessly while maintaining exact version control.

## Key Concepts of Nix

- **Declarative Configurations:** Environments and configurations are defined in .nix files, making them reproducible.

- **Immutable Packages:** Nix stores packages in a unique, hashed location `/nix/store/$hash-$packagename`, ensuring no conflicts between versions where `$hash` represents the hash id of the package and `$packagename` refers to the name of the package itself. For example, if I do the follwing in my terminal:
    ```bash
    nix-shell -p gcc
    ```
    Nix would go and evaluate the package derivation from nixpkgs and store it in `/nix/store/xzfmarrq8x8s4ivpya24rrndqsq2ndiz-gcc-13.3.0`
    > __NOTE:__ `/nix/store` is an immutable file-system which means the user can only access it read-only.

- **Version Locking:** Using tools like `flakes` or `nixpkgs`, you can pin specific versions of packages for consistent builds.

## What is nixpkgs?
`nixpkgs` is a central repository that contains thousands of software packages available in Nix. It acts as the foundation for most Nix-based configurations and is continuously updated to include new packages and fixes. You can view the repo in [GitHub.](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)

```bash
nix-shell -p neovim git
```
This command starts a `bash` shell environment with neovim and git installed, without affecting your system configuration.

## What is flakes?
Flakes are an experimental feature that enhances reproducibility by locking dependencies and configurations in a standardized format. It is intended to replace `default.nix` which you would normally use in a Nix system. This brings a new schema where you can define your packages from the web in `inputs` and build package or a shell for the user.
```nix
{
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs";
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {
    devShell.x86_64-linux = nixpkgs.mkShell {
      buildInputs = [
        nixpkgs.neovim
        nixpkgs.git
      ];
    };
  };
}
```
This allow user to use `nix develop` to enter a shell environment defined by the flake.nix.
