# Templates

nixCats provides several templates to suit different user needs:

1. **Standalone Flake**: A self-contained flake for standalone Neovim configurations.
2. **Nix Expression Flake Outputs**: Combines Neovim into your system flake.
3. **Lua Utilities**: Simplifies adapting non-Nix setups to work within nixCats.
